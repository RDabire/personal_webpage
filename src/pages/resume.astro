      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
        I usually sit in the middle of product, data, and engineering. The best
        projects for me start a little messy, get shaped with the team, and end
        up as something useful in day-to-day work.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
        A lot of my work has been in mining and heavy industry, but the same
        rules keep showing up everywhere: understand the workflow, build with
        constraints, ship fast, and keep listening to users.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
        Outside project delivery, I like writing practical ML notes and helping
        teams get better at modern AI without the hype spiral.
