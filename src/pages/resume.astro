      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Executive Summary</h2>
      <div class="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          I am an experienced AI and Data Science professional with hands-on
          expertise across the entire lifecycle of delivering solutions. My
          background combines programming, applied statistics, and machine
          learning with practical deployment experience in production
          environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked on projects spanning generative AI, predictive
          analytics, and natural language processing, with a focus on turning
          ideas into systems that are reliable, scalable, and trusted. My
          experience extends from problem framing and model development through
          to deployment, automation, and MLOps. I also enjoy teaching and
          mentoring others, building AI literacy, and helping organisations
          adopt AI responsibly.
        </p>
        <p>
          My foundations are in the mining and resources sector, but the
          principles of my work apply across industries. I bring a blend of
          technical skill, operational awareness, and leadership capability that
          enables me to translate AI from experimentation into measurable
          business outcomes.
