Hi, and welcome to my corner of the internet.

This space is where I’ll be sharing what I’ve learned while working in AI, data science, and analytics. I’ve spent the last few years building and deploying systems in real organisations, and one thing that has become very clear is that success isn’t just about chasing the latest shiny model. It’s about getting the basics right and making technology genuinely useful for the people who rely on it.

You’ll notice some of what I write will have a flavour of mining and resources. That’s the industry I work in today, and it has plenty of tough, interesting problems. But I’ll always try to keep things broad and grounded in first principles so the lessons are useful no matter what industry you’re in.

## What you can expect here

- Notes on lessons learned from real projects: the wins, the near misses, and the messy middle
- Why fundamentals still matter when you want to scale AI responsibly
- Walkthroughs and how-tos for the tools I use day to day
- Occasional detours into cloud infrastructure, MLOps, and the wider stack that makes AI possible

## Why I’m writing

There’s already plenty of noise around AI. I want this space to stay practical, honest, and value driven. If a post helps you avoid a mistake I’ve made, gives you a shortcut, or sparks a new idea, then I’ll count that as a win.

Thanks for stopping by. I’m looking forward to sharing more and seeing where this journey goes.

If you’ve found something valuable in my writing, I’d be glad if you connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-dabire/). And if you share or expand on these ideas in your own posts, just tag me so I can follow along.
